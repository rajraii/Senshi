        <h2>Energy crisis</h2>
          <p>Energy crisis and environmental concerns raised the necessity for the new biofuels. 
              Biodiesel is a clean alternative to fossil fuel. A green approach for biodiesel production through enzymatic 
              biodiesel production has gained a lot of attention due to the drawbacks of chemical methods. Promising enzymatic 
              processes are established for biodiesel production. The main obstacle for the industrialization of enzymatic 
              process would be overall cost of production. Production cost could be reduced by increasing the 
              productivity or by increasing the catalytic efficiency of lipases. Immobilization and genetic engineering methods 
              appear to be an attractive way to obtain more active, stable, and reusable lipases in different reaction systems. 
              Operational parameters like water content, temperature, solvent, acyl acceptors, and so on plays key role in 
              transesterification process. Along with all these technical operational conditions, novel bioreactor designing has 
              also promising challenges in order to make biodiesel a great potential commercial fuel in future.
              During election years, there is a renewed debate on how “real” the energy crisis is in the world. 
              One side will always say it is based on faulty science and politics; the other will say that the other side is basing
             their findings on junk science and political interests. The best way to sum up the reality of the energy crisis is that
             you cannot have growing demands on limited resources without eventually running out of the resource.
            That is just common sense. What is really at play in the discussion about how real the energy crisis is concerns the perception 
            of responsibility for the future. There is no real energy crisis if you are not concerned about life after your time on Earth is 
            gone. However, there is a genuine energy crisis if you care about the future that the next generations will inherit.<br>
