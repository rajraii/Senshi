        <h2>China Energy Crisis ? </h2>

            <p class= "Energyclass"> China is heavily dependent on coal burning for power production, with more than 70 percent of its electricity generation being reliant on coal, according to a Bloomberg report.<br>

                The problem is that because China is re-opening after spending months in lockdown, the demand for electricity has risen, which means the demand for coal has risen. Higher demands have led to a surge in coal prices. <br>
                
                But the Chinese government keeps electricity prices low, especially in residential areas, according to New York Times. Because electricity demand has risen but the prices haven't, power plants are operating below full capacity and unwilling to lose money by increasing electricity generation, according to Lin Boqiang, dean of Xiamen University, who is also the dean of the China Institute for Energy Policy Studies.<em> is the energy crisis real? </em>
                The line draws between the right and left with commits such as, "its fault of science" or "the industries and richer are the reason behind the energy crisis". Somewhere down the rope, they misdirect from the main topic to unrelated conversations.<br>
                
                This ambitious target has led to stricter emission standards that the Chinese are strictly following. China promised to slash energy intensity by three percent in 2021 in order to live up to its environmental vows.<br>

Xi's promises regarding carbon intensity targets have not strayed far from the emission guidelines, especially due to enforcement at the provincial level, reported The Guardian. <br>

In the first few months of 2021, only a third of the Chinese provinces reported that they had achieved their goals of cutting energy intensity.

        <h2> Possible Solutions & Their Shortcomings ? </h2>
          <p> There could have been three ways to tackle this kind of a crisis, but in China's case none seem to show any potential in working out in the long run – digging out more coal, importing coal, or relying on non-coal sources of energy.<br>

            Digging more coal mines is not as simple as it sounds because any new mines have to meet strict environmental guidelines, safety rules (especially after a deadly accident in Shanxi a few months ago), and the new rules regarding China's mission to reduce the share of coal in energy production, Bloomberg reported. <br>
            
            Coal imports could have been a solution since China has been a major importer. But it recently imposed an export ban on coal from Australia due to trade tensions. While it increased its coal purchases from Indonesia, the demand for coal within China has also risen sharply. <br>
            
            Therefore, unless other countries increase exports to China, like Mongolia, this solution is not viable either. <br>
            
            Completely relying on alternate, renewable sources for electricity generation is also risky. For instance, hydropower production in China depends on the rain. A delayed start to the monsoon decreased hydropower generation in southern China that forced authorities to begin power rationing, the Bloomberg report added.<br>
            
            Other sources of renewable energy like wind, solar and nuclear energy have only recently started growing.
